# Lyterbox

Lyterbox is a tiny lightbox script that handles images and iframes.

Lyterbox removes some features from the original Lytebox, like themeing and slideshows, in order to reduce file size.

Lyterbox was forked from [Terrill Nederveld's Lytebox (v4.0a)](https://github.com/tnederveld/Lytebox), which was forked from [Markus Hay's original Lytebox (v3.22)](http://lytebox.com/), which was based on [Lokesh Dhakar's Lightbox (v2.02)](http://huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2).
